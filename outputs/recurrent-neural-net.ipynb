Within deep learning, two learning approaches are used, supervised and unsupervised. This tutorial focuses on recurrent neural networks (RNN), which use supervised deep learning and sequential learning to develop a model. This deep learning technique is especially useful when handling time series data, as is used in this tutorial."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["In this tutorial, the goal is to create a basic model that can predict a stock's value using daily Open, High, Low, and Close values. Because the stock market can be extremely volatile, there are many factors that can influence and contribute to a stock's value. This tutorial uses the following parameters for the stock data:\n","\n","- **Open**: The stock's price when the market opens.\n","- **High**: The highest price at which a stock is trading during market hours.\n","- **Low**: The lowest price at which a stock is trading during market hours.\n","- **Close**: The stock's price when the market closes. This price is used by financial institutions as the value of a stock on a particular day because it takes into consideration all of the day's events and any fluctuations that might have occurred during the market.\n","\n","The overall importance of the Close value and its use as a benchmark for a stock's daily value indicates that this value is the one to use in the prediction. To accomplish this, you can build a model that uses long short-term memory (LSTM), an RNN technique, to store and analyze larger sets of time series data.\n","\n","This tutorial uses stock market data that is collected by IBM Watson and deployed on IBM Watson Studio on IBM Cloud Pak for Data."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Learning objectives\n","In the tutorial, you import a Jupyter Notebook that is written in Python into IBM Watson Studio on IBM Cloud Pak for Data, then run through the Notebook.
