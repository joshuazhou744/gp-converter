## Convert IBM tutorials to jupyter notebooks so they can be made into gps and whatnot

Make sure you have an OpenAI API key in a .env file

Source the venv with the command below

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Run the following

```bash
python main.py
```

Enter the url, enter a name for the notebook

Wait and the notebook should appear in `/outputs`. You'll see a temporary pdf file appear there but it'll be deleted after use.
